        Ca’ Fortuna has a truly tranquil neighbourhood feel, surrounded by excellent local restaurants and only metres from all amenities.  All Venice's sights are within easy walking distance or a short vaporetto ride away.

              Hi, my name is Linda and I live in Sydney, Australia. My favourite city other than Sydney is Venice which is why I have a home here.  I travel here often and can never get enough of this unique and beautiful city.  I hope you will come to love it as much as I do and return again and again!
