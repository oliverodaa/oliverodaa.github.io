				<h2><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Connect Four Minimax AI</h2>
				<p>I wanted to revisit the Connect Four AI and interactive game I had created in Snap! for my first CS class at Berkeley, CS10.
				I worked hard to learn about minimax AI and to subsequently implement what I had learned in a Python 3 terminal-based game. 
				I learned JavaScript in order to rewrite the project for a client-side browser interface. Try to win against my AI!

				<h2><i class="fa fa-university"></i> SAO Website Redesign</h2>
	      		<p>In the Spring of 2014 I was approached with an opportunity to replace the ASUC Student Advocate's Office website. As a caseworker at the SAO I'm extremely passionate about our mission to support students in their disputes within UC Berkeley.</p>
	      		<p> The information and support we provide is vital to the lives of students. Since the website's completion we have had over 4000 unique visits.</p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-music"></i> UCMC Website Redesign</h2>
	      		<p>After becoming a co-manager of the UC Men's Chorale in Fall 2014, I saw a need to update the website. As my very first choir conductor always said, "People hear with their eyes as much as their ears". If that's true then people had been hearing something that was ugly, outdated and not very user-friendly.</p>
	      		<p> More importantly, the old site <a href="http://ucmc.berkeley.edu/old">(click here to see it!)</a> was written in straight html, and was therefore tedious to update. This site is built in Wordpress and, through use of a MySQL database, can be edited within the browser, no coding ability required!</p>
	      		<a href="http://ucmc.berkeley.edu/" class="btn btn-primary">Expore the site!</a>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-users"></i> UC Chorale Ensembles Website Implementation</h2>
	      		<p>In Fall 2014, I was tasked with not only a website redesign, but also the transfer of an entire organisation to a new (much better) interface for updating website content. The site needed to be easy to edit for managers of chorale groups, and also attractive and user-friendly. The site is a vital channel for donations to UCCE.</p>
	      		<p>UC Chorale Ensembles is the parent company of the UC Men's Chorale and has more than thirty managers and directors with various and often conflicting personal interests. Despite these challenges, the resulting website is both beautiful and functional, making life better for UCCE and its audience.</p>
