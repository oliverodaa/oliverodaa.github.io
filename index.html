			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				I made this page as a fun project and as a place to share future projects. Here's a photo of me in Wisconsin!

			<h3>Connect Four</h3>
			<br>
			I wanted to revisit the Connect Four AI and interactive game I had created in Snap! for my first CS class at Berkeley, CS10. I worked hard to learn about minimax AI and to subsequently implement what I had learned in a Python 3 terminal-based game. I had trouble sharing what I had made with friends, so I learned JavaScript in order to rewrite the project for a client-side browser interface. Porting the program from Python to JavaScript was really rewarding because I got to know the subtleties of both languages. Try to win against my AI! Blah blah.

			<h3>Knight's Tour</h3>
			<br>
			I wrote a <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~olivero/files/knightour.txt"> solution</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight's_tour">Knight's Tour Problem</a> for Python 3.3.4. It's super fast compared to the brute force version and it was a lot of fun to write. Here's a video of it in action!
