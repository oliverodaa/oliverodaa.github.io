				<h2>About</h2>
	      		<p>My name is Ollie O'Donnell. I'm currently studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Coming here all the way from Australia has certainly been challenging, but it's worth it to live my dream!</p>
	      		<p>In my first few years exploring the world of Computer Science I've grown intellectually, solved challenging problems, and had a lot of fun in the process!</p>
